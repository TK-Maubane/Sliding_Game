    body: `Picasso is an American Pitbull Terrier. He is a mid-sized ball of mischievous energy!
            The little always has his golden coat on, and his favourite little white socks (hind legs
            get ankle-length socks). He has greenish-amber eyes, and a pink nose (very rare).`,

    caption: "Not just a pretty face...",
    body: `Picasso is relatively easy to train. He currently understands and responds to; 
            SIT, RELAX and ETLA ("come" in seTswana) commands. He would likely respond to a lot more if only
            his owner spent more time training him and less time cuddling and playing tug-of-war with him.
            He does not understand VOETSEK, and just stares at you insultingly when you say/yell that command.`,

    body: ` His current diet is dog pellets and pet mince. He is actually kinda spoilt, and will often 
            refuse his meals if there isn't mince included. Due to this, he has become a somewhat muscular guy.`,

    body: `Picasso is very friendly, especially towards children. He can be protective of his family/owners, 
        however he's all bark and zero bite. He also plays well with other dogs as he was well socialized 
        as a puppy.`,
